# QA_BOT

QA_BOT is a Question and Answer system that allows users to ask questions and receive intelligent responses using a Machine Learning / NLP model.  
This project demonstrates how to integrate a trained language model with a simple interface for interactive question answering.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Accepts natural language questions from users
- Processes queries using a trained NLP model
- Returns relevant and concise answers
- Can be extended to use custom datasets or external APIs

## 🧠 How It Works
1.User Input – The bot takes a natural language question.

2.Preprocessing – The question is tokenized and transformed into a format the model understands.

3.Model Inference – The trained NLP model predicts the most relevant answer.

4.Output – The bot displays the answer to the user.
